## Research Overview

**Our research focuses on understanding the complex interplay between the microbiome, the immune system, and the pathophysiology of critical illness**, particularly in the context of sepsis and intensive care. We investigate the microbiological and immunological mechanisms underlying infections and organ dysfunction in ICU patients, with a particular emphasis on gut microbiota dysbiosis and its contribution to nosocomial infections and systemic inflammation.

Through multi-dimensional profiling approaches, **we aim to characterize microbiota-immune interactions at both the cellular and molecular levels**. This includes in-depth studies of host-microbe dynamics and immune dysfunction during critical illness, leveraging advanced techniques such as intravital imaging and the use of germ-free and gnotobiotic animal models to dissect the mechanisms driving dysbiosis and immune regulation.

**A key objective of our program is the translation of these findings into novel therapeutic strategies**. We are developing precision microbiota-editing tools to restore healthy microbiota-immune mutualism and exploring innovative immunotherapies to enhance host defense mechanisms against infections and sepsis. Our ultimate goal is to enable targeted, mechanism-based interventions to prevent and treat infections in critically ill patients.
